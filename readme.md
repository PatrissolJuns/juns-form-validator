## About Juns Form Validator: JFV

JFV (Juns Frorm Validator) is a set of function which provides for a website some usefully shortcuts to handle verification of HTML forms. 

It is very easy to use and setup.


## How to use JFV ?

Since JFV is build with javascript and jquery so you need to import jquery at least version 2.0.

So Just include `jfv.js`, `jfv.css` and `jquery.js`file.

Then you need to bind the class `jfv-form` to the form you which to check.

E.g: 

```html
<form class="jfv-form">

...

</form>
```

This validator use concept of data attribute of HTML 5. As you will see almost everything here will turn around data-attribute so let us start with the form.


### Form
 
If you want to perform an `ajax request` rather than normal request, you should edit your form tag as follows:

```html
<form class="jfv-form" data-ajax="true">

...

</form>
```

**Note:**: By default the value of `data-ajax` is consider to `false` even thought it is ommitted while defining the form tag.


### Input of type text

The first thing you need to do in order to activate the validation of an input element is to set `data-validate="true"` otherwise, the validator will just ignore the input.

Now let us see hhow JFV handles different type of validation


#### Min and max validation

If you want your input value to be between 3 and 10 caracters, you just need to set `jfv-type="range"` to that input and then precise the value of the minimum and the value of 

the maximum this way`data-min="3"` and `data-max="10"`.

Example:

```html
<input type="text" data-type="range" data-min="3" data-max="10">
```


#### Equal validation

If you want your input value to be equal to 5 caracters, you just need to set `data-type="equal"` and `data-equal="5"` to that input.

Example:

```html
<input type="text" data-type="equal" data-equal="5">
```


#### Input of type password

The handling of password fields is a little bit different form the text fields one. Because here you have the possibility to bind the password confirm like so:

```html
<label for="password">Password:</label>

<input type="password" id="password" data-type="password" data-min="3" data-max="10">

<label for="password">Confirmation:</label>

<input type="password" data-type="password" data-ref="password">
```

By that way you can easily check if the two password are equals.

**Note:**: 

Here you must sure that the confirm password field `data-ref` the value of the `data-ref` property of the confirm password field is the id of the password field which is refer to.

Here you have to make sure that the field that has to confirm the password has the attribute `data-ref` and which is worth the id of the password concerned

By default, the program consider that the id of the password field is equal to "password".


#### Input of type email

Here there is nothing to setting because the email fields are automatically handle.


#### Number validation

Here we have 2 cases:

1- The attribute text of the input field is equal to `"number"`. In this case, there is nothing to configure. Par example vous voulez un prix qui soit compris entre 5 et 25 alors faite comme suit:

```html
<input type="number" data-min="5" data-max="25">
```

2- The attribute text of the input field is equal to `"text"`. In this case, you should just defined `data-type="number"` and that is all. All other features remain valid so 

if you want for example to have a size between 1.55 and 2.1 meters, do it in the following way

```html
<input type="text" data-min="1.55" data-max="2.1">
```

### Textarea

There is nothing to set up here, that means all the other features are available. For example, to define a textarea that must contain at least 10 characters, 

it must be done as follows:

```html
<textarea data-type="range" data-min="10" > 
```

## Style

This system uses 7 classes css which allow it to make the syntatic coloring They are:

`.jfv-input-information:` Which allows to color the input in blue to signal a successful result during the verification.
Example:

[![jfv-input-information.png](https://i.postimg.cc/XJ7vZ935/jfv-input-information.png)](https://postimg.cc/QBwDw9FN)

`.jfv-input-invalid`: This allows to color the input in red to report an error during the verification.

Example:

[![jfv-input-invalid.png](https://i.postimg.cc/d0F2xNmK/jfv-input-invalid.png)](https://postimg.cc/SnZYXrvZ)

`.jfv-input-valid`: Which allows to color the input in green to report a success during the verification.

[![jfv-input-valid.png](https://i.postimg.cc/GmwG4gfs/jfv-input-valid.png)](https://postimg.cc/7f9fc9wx)

Theses classes below are only available when you have set `data-label` attribute for more information see this section below. They are:

`.jfv-label-information:` Which allows to color the label in blue to signal a successful result during the verification.
Example:

[![jfv-with-label-color.png](https://i.postimg.cc/X7Mk5vGJ/jfv-with-label-color.png)](https://postimg.cc/fkKdnDvn)

`.jfv-label-invalid`: This allows to color the label in red to report an error during the verification.
Example:

[![jfv-label-failed.png](https://i.postimg.cc/6q6zmWRR/jfv-label-failed.png)](https://postimg.cc/r0bSdLfF)

`.jfv-label-valid`: Which allows to color the label in green to report a success during the verification.

[![jfv-label-information.png](https://i.postimg.cc/ZnfjkGFQ/jfv-label-information.png)](https://postimg.cc/y3Z0crGh)

The last class is `.jfv-display-error-message` Which allows to display the error message at the bottom of the field.


### Error messages

For this current version, the error message will appear just at the bottom of the input 

For this version, the error messages will appear just below the corresponding fields and will have the class `jfv-display-error-message`. 

So itâ€™s quite done possible to edit them as you wish.

Concerning the labels, if you want the labels to also take the color of the result of the verification, it will be enough to match the id of this label in attribute `data-label` of the input concerned.


Example:

```html
<label id="nom_label">Nom : </label>
<input type="text" data-label="nom_label">
```

### Language

Also for this version, the error messages will be available in 2 languages: English and French.

### Others

If you have a field that does not need to be validated, but still want to have the syntatic color of the field validate, you can use `data-type="empty"`. 

it will be fair to say that the field is valid without any check on it.


#### Desactivation

If you do not want to check a field just add `data-validate="false"`to the correspondent field.

#### Field required

Sometimes, you may need to have a field that is required it means the field must have a value. To make it work, you should just set `data-type="required"`.


#### Optionality

If you want to make a field to be optional it means that the value must not be present but if there is any value it would be checked according to want you have setting for.

To make it work, you must set `data-optiona="true"`.


#### Phone validation

since almost every country in the world has its own way of formatting phone numbers, therefore there was no provision for a universal phone validator. However, you have the

opportunity to configure your own phone validator, by following the existing models:

1- Set the `data-phone="name_of_your_country"` attribute example `data-phone="USA"` or `data-phone="England"`.

2- Make sure that your function will return the type of response which are:
	
2-1- `[true, ""]` if the value enterred by the user is correct

2-2- `[false, "some error message"]` if the value enterred by the user is not correct

Otherwise an error may happear.
